# 🎧 Chatterbox Audiobook Generator

**This is a work in progress. You can consider this a pre-launch repo at the moment, but if you find bugs, please put them in the issues area. Thank you.**
**Transform your text into high-quality audiobooks with advanced TTS models, voice cloning, and professional volume normalization.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🪟 Windows

**1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
./install-audiobook.bat
```

**2. Launch the Application**
```bash
./launch_audiobook.bat
```

The web interface will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:7860`

**3. CUDA Issue Fix (If Needed)**

If you encounter CUDA assertion errors during generation:
```bash
# Activate your virtual environment first
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Install the CUDA-fixed version
pip install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir "chatterbox-tts @ git+https://github.com/fakerybakery/better-chatterbox@fix-cuda-issue"
```

---

### 🍎 macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel)

Chatterbox runs on Mac with Metal GPU acceleration (MPS) on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) and CPU on Intel Macs.

**1. Create and activate a conda environment**
```bash
conda create -n chatterbox python=3.10
conda activate chatterbox
```

**2. Install PyTorch for Mac**
```bash
conda install pytorch::pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch
```

**3. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install "setuptools<70"
pip install -r requirements-mac.txt
```

**4. Install the package**
```bash
pip install -e . --no-deps
```

**5. Download the spaCy language model**
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

**6. Launch the application**
```bash
python gradio_audiobook_app.py
```

The web interface will open at `http://localhost:7860`

> **Note:** `setuptools<70` is required because librosa 0.10.0 depends on `pkg_resources`, which is missing from newer setuptools versions shipped with conda.

## 🆕 New in v2

Built on the original [Chatterbox TTS](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox) by Resemble AI.

- **Clean single-page UI** — replaces the previous complex multi-tab interface; everything you need on one screen
- **Single Voice** — upload or record your own voice sample, then generate a script of any length
- **Multi-Voice** — tag characters as `[Name]: dialogue`, assign a voice sample to each character, and generate a full cast audiobook
- **Progressive output** — audio updates chunk by chunk as it generates, so you hear results immediately without waiting for the full script to finish
- **Mac-optimised** — Metal GPU (MPS) acceleration on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4); automatic CPU fallback on Intel Macs
- **Microphone recording built-in** — record your voice directly in the browser for instant voice cloning, no external tools needed

## 🎭 Custom Audiobook Processing Pipeline ⭐ *NEW*

Our advanced text processing pipeline transforms your written content into natural-sounding audiobooks with intelligent pause placement and character flow management.

### 🔇 **Return Pause System**

**Automatic pause insertion based on your text formatting** - Every line break (`\n`) in your text automatically adds a 0.1-second pause to the generated audio, creating natural speech rhythms without manual intervention.

#### **How It Works**
- **Line Break Detection**: System automatically counts all line breaks in your text
- **Pause Calculation**: Each return adds exactly 0.1 seconds of silence
- **Accumulative Pauses**: Multiple consecutive line breaks create longer pauses
- **Universal Support**: Works with single-voice, multi-voice, and batch processing

#### **Example Text Formatting**
```
[Narrator] The sun was setting over the hills.

[Character1] "We need to find shelter soon."

[Character2] "I see a cave up ahead.
Let's hurry before it gets dark."


[Narrator] They rushed toward the cave, hearts pounding.
```
**Result**: Natural pauses between dialogue, emphasis pauses for dramatic effect, and smooth character transitions.

### 📝 **Text Formatting Best Practices**

#### **🎭 Multi-Voice Dialogue Structure**
```
[Character Name] Dialogue content here.

[Another Character] Response content here.
Multiple lines can be used for the same character.

[Narrator] Descriptive text and scene setting.
```

#### **🎪 Natural Flow Techniques**
- **Paragraph Breaks**: Use double line breaks for scene transitions
- **Emphasis Pauses**: Add extra returns before important revelations
- **Character Separation**: Single returns between different speakers
- **Breathing Room**: Natural pauses for complex concepts or emotional moments

#### **📖 Single Voice Formatting**
```
Chapter content flows naturally here.

New paragraphs create natural pauses.


Extended pauses can emphasize dramatic moments.

Regular text continues with normal pacing.
```

### 🔄 **Processing Pipeline Features**

#### **🧠 Intelligent Text Analysis**
- **Line Break Preservation**: Maintains your formatting intentions throughout processing
- **Character Assignment**: Automatically maps voice tags to selected voice profiles
- **Chunk Optimization**: Breaks long texts into optimal segments while preserving pause timing
- **Error Recovery**: Validates text and provides helpful formatting suggestions

#### **⚡ Real-Time Processing**
- **Live Feedback**: Console output shows exactly how many pauses are being added
- **Debug Information**: Detailed logging of pause detection and application
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor pause processing alongside audio generation
- **Quality Assurance**: Automatic validation of pause placement

#### **🎚️ Professional Output**
- **Seamless Integration**: Pauses blend naturally with generated speech
- **Volume Consistency**: Silence segments match the audio output specifications
- **Format Compatibility**: Works with all supported audio formats and quality settings
- **Project Preservation**: Pause information saved in project metadata for regeneration

### 💡 **Pro Tips for Better Audiobooks**

#### **🎯 Dialogue Formatting**
- **Character Consistency**: Always use the same character name format `[Name]`
- **Natural Breaks**: Place returns where a human reader would naturally pause
- **Scene Transitions**: Use multiple returns (2-3) for major scene changes
- **Emotional Beats**: Add single returns before/after emotional dialogue

#### **📚 Chapter Structure**
```
Chapter 1: The Beginning

Opening paragraph with scene setting.

"Character dialogue with natural flow."

Descriptive narrative continues.


Major scene transition with extended pause.

New section begins here.
```

#### **🎪 Advanced Techniques**
- **Cliffhangers**: Use extended pauses before revealing crucial information
- **Action Sequences**: Shorter, punchy sentences with minimal pauses for intensity
- **Contemplative Moments**: Longer pauses for reflection and character development
- **Comedic Timing**: Strategic pauses before punchlines or comedic reveals

### 🔍 **Debug Output Examples**

When generating your audiobook, watch for these helpful console messages:
```
🔇 Detected 15 line breaks → 1.5s total pause time
🔇 Line breaks detected in [Character1]: +0.3s pause (from 3 returns)
🔇 Chunk 2 (Narrator): Added 0.2s pause after speech
```

This real-time feedback helps you understand exactly how your formatting translates to audio timing.
